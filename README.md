# COVID-19
COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an infectious disease caused by **severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)**, previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a strain of coronavirus. The first cases were seen in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 before spreading globally. The current outbreak was officially recognized as a pandemic on **11 March 2020**.No effective treatment or vaccine exists currently (April 2020).
# DESCRIPTION
Since reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits are in limited supply, there exists a need to explore alternative means of identifying and prioritizing suspected cases of COVID-19. In our City of Gujarat, Surat, turnaround time for COVID-19 test results is currently reported as 24 hours. It is possible that this turnaround time is even greater in rural and remote regions.
Moreover, large scale implementation of the COVID-19 tests which are extremely expensive cannot be afforded by many of the developing & underdeveloped countries hence if we can have some parallel diagnosis/testing procedures using Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning and leveraging the historical data, it will be extremely helpful. This can also help in the process to select the ones to be tested primarily.
